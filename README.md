# Unclosed or Extra Closing HTML Tag Bug

This repository demonstrates a common HTML error: an extra closing tag that doesn't have a matching opening tag. This can lead to validation errors and unpredictable behavior in browsers.

## Bug Description

The `bug.html` file contains an extra closing `div` tag.  This invalidates the HTML structure. While browsers may try to interpret this gracefully, it's not correct HTML and could cause unexpected layout problems or be vulnerable to errors.

## Solution

The `solution.html` file demonstrates the corrected code.  The extra closing tag has been removed, resulting in valid and consistent HTML.

## How to reproduce the bug

1. Open `bug.html` in your browser.
2. Validate the HTML using a validator (e.g., the W3C Markup Validation Service).
3. Observe the validation errors. The validator will identify the extra closing tag.
